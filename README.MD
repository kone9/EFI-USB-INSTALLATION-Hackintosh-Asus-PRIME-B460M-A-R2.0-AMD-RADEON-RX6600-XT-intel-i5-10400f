 #EFI For installation of MacOS ventura with USB.

Note that there are two branches in this repository. One for the EFI that goes on the USB that is used to install the OS and the other EFI is for when you have the OS installed.
The EFI of the installed operating system has things that the EFI of installation does not.
That is, once you finished installing the operating system with the EFI on the USB, to correctly boot the installed system you have to use the EFI in the "EFI INSTALLED" branch.
